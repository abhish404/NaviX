# NaviX - AI-Powered Route Optimization

NaviX is an AI-powered route optimization and visualization tool designed to optimize sales vehicle routes efficiently. It focuses on maximizing potential sales while minimizing costs using machine learning and heuristic algorithms.

## üöÄ Features

- **Optimization Mode**: Assigns delivery points to distribution centers while minimizing travel costs.
- **Recommendation Mode**: Suggests optimal locations for distribution points and vehicle allocations.
- **Visualization**: Interactive mapping using Streamlit and Mapbox to display delivery routes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Modified K-NN for clustering destinations.
- **Routing Optimization**: K-Means clustering and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) optimization.
- **Visualization**: Streamlit and Mapbox for real-time route visualization.
- **Cloud Services**: Azure Maps (routing API), Azure ML, and Azure App Service.

## üìå Project Workflow

1. **Cluster delivery points** using a modified K-Means algorithm.
2. **Assign optimized vehicle routes** while minimizing fuel costs.
3. **Optimize final routes** using TSP algorithms.
4. **Visualize the results** on an interactive dashboard.

## üéØ Why This Project?

This project showcases my skills in:

- **AI-driven optimization**
- **Cloud-based development**
- **Interactive data visualization**

It was developed as part of a hackathon challenge, demonstrating my ability to solve real-world logistics problems efficiently.
